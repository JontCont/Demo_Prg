Function: 
Write a Command Interpreter (CI) that repeatedly read and execute the command inputted by the user, until a "done" command is read. 

Requirement: 
The file should be named as prog3. The CI should use fork() and execvp() function to execute the user command, and wait for the completion of the execution of the user command.

Hint: Example file ex07 can be a reference.

[root@teacher ex07]# ./prog3
input command: ls
execv1  execv1.c  fork1  fork1.c  prog3  prog3.c  system1  system1.c
input command: pwd
/home/ex07
input command: ps
